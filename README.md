## Problem Statement

In Indonesia, bubble sheet tests are a widely used assessment method in schools, but grading these tests remains a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone task for teachers. The existing applications that automate grading are limited to specific templates, which do not accommodate the diverse formats of bubble sheets used in Indonesian schools.

Rully aims to address this problem by developing an AI-powered bubble sheet grader capable of accurately and efficiently grading various bubble sheet formats. Leveraging advanced image recognition and machine learning technologies, Rully's solution will automate the grading process, significantly reducing the time and effort required from teachers and minimizing the potential for human error.

By offering a versatile and user-friendly tool, Rully will enhance the educational experience in Indonesian schools, allowing teachers to focus more on instruction and less on administrative tasks. This innovative approach promises to streamline the grading process, improve accuracy, and adapt to the diverse needs of educators across the country.
